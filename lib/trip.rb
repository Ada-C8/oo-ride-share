# Each trip should:

# Have an ID, passenger ID, a driver ID, date, rating. - Instance variables completed.
# Each rating should be within an acceptable range (1-5).

# Given a trip object, you should be able to:

# Retrieve the associated driver instance through the driver ID.
# Retrieve the associated passenger instance through the passenger ID.

# You should be able to:

# Find all trip instances for a given driver ID.
# Find all trip instances for a given passenger ID.
# Retrieve all trips from the CSV file. <--- Done
